## CoreMedia Labs

Welcome to [CoreMedia Labs](https://blog.coremedia.com/labs/)! This repository is part of a platform for developers who want to have a look under the hood or  get some hands-on understanding of the vast and compelling capabilities of CoreMedia. Whatever your experience level with CoreMedia is, we've got something for you.

Each project in our Labs platform is an extra feature to be used with CoreMedia, including extensions, tools and 3rd party integrations. We provide some test data and explanatory videos for non-customers and for insiders there is open-source code and instructions on integrating the feature into your CoreMedia workspace. 

The code we provide is meant to be example code, illustrating a set of features that could be used to enhance your CoreMedia experience. We'd love to hear your feedback on use-cases and further developments! If you're having problems with our code, please refer to our issues section. If you already have a solution to an issue, we love to review and integrate your pull requests.
